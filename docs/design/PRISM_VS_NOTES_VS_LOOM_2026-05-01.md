# Prism vs. Notes vs. Loom — Camp C as Loom's Render Position

**Filed:** 2026-05-01
**Status:** Design rationale for `docs/canon/LOOM.md` §1.5 (Camp C positioning) + §6.5 (engineering decomposition) + `plans/loom-camp-c-editable-render.md` (phased plan)
**Author:** Claude, in dialog with product owner
**Trigger:** Product owner observation that Apple Notes + AI workflow demonstrated a third path between LaTeX/Prism's frozen-beautiful and Notion/Notes' editable-mediocre

---

## 1. The dichotomy that has held knowledge tools captive

For ~30 years, knowledge tools have been forced into one of two camps:

### Camp A — Compiled / frozen output

**Examples:** LaTeX (1985), Typst (2023), Pandoc → PDF, Adobe InDesign (for static docs), Prism (academic auto-typesetter), Quarto, R Markdown → PDF, Sphinx → HTML.

**Properties:**
- Render quality: **academic / print-grade**. Hyphenation, kerning, ligatures, math typography, figure layout, page-on-deck, hanging punctuation, oldstyle figures — all delivered.
- Editing: edit a SOURCE file (`.tex`, `.typ`, `.md`, `.qmd`), then run a COMPILE step. The output is read-only.
- Mental model: **artifact production**. You produce a deliverable; it freezes; revising means going back to source.

**Strengths:**
- Highest possible visual quality
- Reproducible from source
- Long-form structure (books, papers, theses) handled natively
- AI-aided source editing works fine (you're editing text)

**Weaknesses:**
- Compile cycles slow
- Source language is a barrier (LaTeX / Typst syntax is not natural)
- Cannot tweak the rendered output
- Edit mid-stream during reading is impossible
- Once a PDF is shared, future edits require re-distribution

### Camp B — WYSIWYG / live editing

**Examples:** Notion (2016), Google Docs (2006), Apple Notes, Obsidian (with WYSIWYG plugins), Microsoft Word, Confluence, Substack editor, Medium editor.

**Properties:**
- Render quality: **adequate**. Headings, lists, tables, code blocks, basic emphasis, basic math (some support KaTeX). NOT page-on-deck, NOT hanging punctuation, NOT oldstyle figures, NOT real small caps. Print-CSS is an afterthought.
- Editing: the rendered surface IS the document. Click to edit. No compile step.
- Mental model: **continuous draft**. The document evolves; "publish" is a sharing action, not a freeze.

**Strengths:**
- Zero edit friction
- Real-time collaboration possible (Notion, Google Docs)
- Mobile-friendly editing
- Block-level operations (drag, duplicate)
- Native AI integration possible (Notion AI, Google Doc AI)

**Weaknesses:**
- Typography is corner-cut everywhere
- Math renders crudely or via plugins
- Figure / table layout is fragile
- Long-form structure (chapters, footnotes, references) is shoehorned
- Print output looks amateur compared to Camp A

### The forced choice

Until now, every knowledge tool picked Camp A or Camp B. Hybrid attempts (Obsidian's preview pane, Quarto's interactive notebook) split the screen — they don't dissolve the dichotomy, they show both sides.

A user who wants academic typography MUST use Camp A. A user who wants editability MUST use Camp B. Wanting both = use two tools in series (compose in Notion, finalize in LaTeX) at the cost of the seam.

## 2. What changed (why Camp C is now possible)

Three enabling shifts converged ~2025-2026:

### Shift 1: Browser CSS reached print quality

- CSS Houdini, container queries, `font-feature-settings`, `font-variant-numeric` `oldstyle-nums`, advanced `@font-face`, hanging punctuation polyfills, hyphenation dictionaries, KaTeX rendering, `text-wrap: balance`, `text-wrap: pretty`, `@page` print styles, color-mix, OKLCH colors — all production-ready in evergreen browsers
- Loom's **paper canon v1.0** (sealed 2026-04-25) demonstrates this: page-on-deck cards + 60-72ch measure + asymmetric inset + zero texture + Vellum identity, all in browser CSS. Visually competitive with InDesign output.

### Shift 2: AI can maintain structural invariants during edits

- 2023's AI: could rewrite a paragraph but couldn't notice "this paragraph is a chapter intro and needs a drop cap"
- 2026's AI: can read structural context (frontmatter, surrounding markup) and make edits that preserve it
- Means: user can edit a paragraph without knowing its structural role; AI keeps the canon intact

### Shift 3: User mental model has caught up

- Notion (2016+) trained an entire cohort that "the rendered surface IS the document"
- ChatGPT / Claude (2022+) trained an entire cohort that "AI is a co-editor, not a separate tool"
- 2026 user expectation: **"why CAN'T I have both quality typography AND in-place edit AND AI co-edit?"** The constraint that produced the dichotomy is no longer a constraint.

## 3. Camp C — Loom's position (revised v4.0 — substrate, not feature pile)

> **v3.0 had this section as "AI co-edit selection toolbar (rewrite/expand/cite/translate/footnote)" being part of Camp C.** That was a feature-pile mistake. **v4.0 corrects**: Camp C is editability of paper canon rendering. AI's role in Camp C is **invisible background plumbing** (passes that organize/typeset/link), NOT user-facing UI affordances. See `tmp/loom-correction-log.md` entry-007 for full reframe.

**Camp C** dissolves the A/B dichotomy by combining three substrate-level properties:

1. **Camp A's typography** — full paper canon (sealed v1.0)
2. **Camp B's editability** — `contenteditable` on the rendered surface; no source/preview split; no compile step
3. **Versioning** — block-level history (Apple Notes parallel)

Plus, layered on top, **invisible AI plumbing** (NOT a user-facing UI feature):
- Background passes (typeset / structure / link / cite) trigger on idle, on open, or manual ⌘↩
- AI-touched content margin-marked subtly (bronze dot in margin); hover for diff + revert
- NO chat box, NO /ai inline command, NO co-edit toolbar, NO AI panel

The user reads at print quality. The user clicks any text and edits in place. AI runs in background and tidies up the structure / typography / cross-links. The structure (chapter ornaments, drop caps, figure layout) survives every edit. Author is the user.

**This is not a research idea.** Each component exists in production today:
- Paper canon CSS: shipped in Loom v1.0 (sealed)
- contenteditable on rich rendered surfaces: shipped in Apple Notes, Notion, Substack
- Background AI passes: closest precedent is Word's spell-check (continuous, background, margin-marked)
- Block versioning: shipped in Apple Notes, Notion

**The integration is novel.** No tool combines paper-canon-grade typography + editability + invisible-AI-passes + block versioning at this fidelity.

## 4. Loom is uniquely positioned to deliver Camp C (revised v4.0)

### Capabilities Loom already has (sealed)
- Paper canon v1.0 (vellum, page-on-deck, 60-72ch, KaTeX, oldstyle, hanging, asymmetric inset, zero texture)
- 5 shape detection (List / Article / Passage / Conversation / Syllabus per Phase C presentation layer)
- Source-fidelity principle (display ≡ Finder tree)
- Sandboxed `LoomFileStore` (immutable source folder protected)
- AI integration framework (`callAiPrompt` Swift bridge, 5 providers + custom + off)
- CaptureAST schema for structured source representation
- Selection toolbar (Highlight / Note / Copy link with transient highlight model added 2026-05-01) — kept for highlighting/copying use; NOT extended with AI affordances
- Vellum visual identity (warm paper + bronze)

### Capabilities Loom needs to add (v4.0 scope — see `plans/loom-camp-c-editable-render.md` + `plans/loom-ai-passes.md` + `plans/loom-cli.md`)

**Editable render (4 modules, not 5):**
- contenteditable on `.loom-capture-article` body
- DOM ↔ Markdown bi-directional binding
- Structural invariant guard (CSS + MutationObserver)
- Block-level versioning + history

**Internal AI plumbing (background passes, NO UI):**
- Idle / on-open / manual triggers
- Typeset / structure / link / cite pass types
- Margin marking with hover diff + revert
- API cost tracking + per-day cap

**External AI integration (CLI + files):**
- 6 commands: capture / search / open / related / render / write
- Standard markdown + frontmatter conventions
- Sandbox-respecting

**NOT in v4.0:**
- ❌ AI co-edit selection toolbar (deleted from v3.0 plan)
- ❌ askPassage / distill UI panels (removed)
- ❌ Wiki-scale AI work (cross-document auto-link/cluster) — deferred to v4.1+

### Why competitors can't do this
- **LaTeX / Prism**: their entire architecture is source-then-compile. Adding edit-in-place would require rewriting the rendering engine to be browser-based + bidirectional. Years of work.
- **Notion**: their typography would need to be rebuilt from scratch. Their editor architecture is block-based at the WRONG granularity for paper canon. Notion AI is a panel; substrate-style invisible-passes are not their pattern.
- **Apple Notes**: not extensible enough. Apple controls the surface; can't add domain-specific renderers (paper canon) or AI passes.
- **Obsidian**: WYSIWYG plugin space exists but typography is community-driven and fragmented; no canonical paper rendering. AI plugins exist but as feature-pile, not as substrate plumbing.
- **Substack**: editor is locked-down; no way to add academic structure or AI plumbing.
- **Quarto / R Markdown**: dual-pane (source + preview); not single-surface edit.
- **Word + Copilot**: closest in spirit (background AI in a substrate), but typography is corner-cut. Word can't deliver paper canon.

Loom comes in fresh, with paper canon already done, AI integration framework already done, and the design discipline (sealed canon, immutable source, hard vetoes, substrate-purity) to maintain quality through edit cycles + AI passes.

### The deepest position statement (substrate, not vertical AI)

Loom is **a Word/PPT/Excel-tier substrate for thought** — universal, stable, predictable, with paper-canon-grade rendering and modern AI plumbing baked in as invisible infrastructure.

Loom is NOT a vertical AI app for knowledge work. Vertical AI apps (Cursor, Notion AI, ChatGPT) compete on AI feature richness. Loom's moat is substrate quality + typography + AI being so well-integrated it's invisible.

This positioning is closer to **Word in 1990s** (universal substrate, conservative on features, deeply right on the things that matter) than to **Cursor in 2026** (vertical AI maximalism). The comparison is intentional.

## 5. What Camp C is NOT

- ❌ Not a Notion replacement. Notion is right for raw collaborative drafts and team docs.
- ❌ Not a LaTeX replacement. LaTeX is right for pure-print artifacts that don't evolve (theses, conference papers, textbooks).
- ❌ Not Obsidian's split-pane preview. There is no source/preview split — the render IS the surface.
- ❌ Not "Loom is a better editor." Loom is a better RENDER + EDIT integration; the editor part is necessary not central.
- ❌ Not an AI feature pile. The 5 co-edit affordances are intentionally minimal; the moat is that they live ON the paper canon, not that there are many of them.

---

## 6. Integration with the 3-layer architecture (also added v3.0)

`docs/canon/LOOM.md` §1.5 introduces the 3-layer architecture: terminal AI thinks, Loom renders, user orchestrates. Camp C lives entirely in the **render** layer:

```
User (orchestrator: vision keeper / capability router / verify gate / memory enforcer)
    │
    │ voice ⌥ / dictation / typing
    ▼
Terminal AI (thinking: Codex / Claude Code)
    │
    │ writes draft / artifact directly to Loom file (via LoomFileStore)
    ▼
Loom (rendering: paper canon + Camp C editability)
    │  ← user reads, edits in place, AI co-edits selections
    │  ← changes write back to source MD
    ▼
Wiki / archive / future re-reading
```

Camp C is the SURFACE where "user reads + edits + AI co-edits" happens. Without Camp C, Loom would be only the read-side endpoint of terminal AI's writes, and users would copy-paste to Notion to actually edit. With Camp C, Loom is the workshop where the artifact lives.

## 7. Honest unknowns (filed in `docs/canon/LOOM.md` §12 and this doc)

These don't block thesis filing but block M3 → M4 promotion until M2 surfaces real data:

1. **Will users edit Loom's rendering, or instinctively close-and-export to Notion?**
   - Hypothesis: paper canon quality + zero-friction edit is sticky enough to keep them
   - Risk: years of "to edit, go to Notion" muscle memory
   - Test: M2 prototype + 1-week user logging

2. **Is selection-based AI co-edit useful for prose?**
   - Hypothesis: yes — Cursor proved it for code, prose has more variation but more flexibility
   - Risk: prose AI suggestions are generic / unhelpful at the paragraph level
   - Test: M4 module (c) ships affordances incrementally; abandon ones unused

3. **Can DOM ↔ MD roundtripping survive Loom's custom components without lossy conversion?**
   - Hypothesis: structured AST as intermediate handles 95% of cases
   - Risk: long-tail of components require ad-hoc handlers
   - Test: M2 naïve roundtrip + cataloguing of failures

4. **What does mobile editing of paper canon look like?**
   - Hypothesis: TBD — paper canon is desktop-first; may need a "draft mode" CSS variant for mobile
   - Risk: paper canon is fundamentally not mobile-editable
   - Test: M5 explores; may discover paper canon is desktop-only and mobile gets a different layer

5. **Is the moat real, or will Notion ship paper-canon-quality typography in 2027?**
   - Hypothesis: Notion's architecture makes this hard; their block model is wrong granularity
   - Risk: large competitor catches up faster than Loom matures
   - Mitigation: Loom's source-anchored learning loop is a deeper moat than typography alone

## 8. Decision log for this design

- 2026-05-01 — Camp C reframe filed by Claude in dialog with product owner. Triggered by user observation: "我看你今天要你做 note，把笔记放到 notes 上，你也做好了很好的排版，但是我随时可以在 notes 上对你进行 edit，这也是个很重要的事情。" Apple Note workflow demonstrated the principle; Loom should deliver the same at paper-canon quality.
- 2026-05-01 — Decision: file thesis (this doc + docs/canon/LOOM.md §1.5 + §6.5 + LOOM_RULES §7.5 + plan), defer code. Honors `tmp/loom-correction-log.md` entry-005 ("don't ship rules for un-lived workflows").

## 9. Glossary

- **Camp A** — frozen-beautiful (LaTeX / Prism / Typst / Pandoc → PDF)
- **Camp B** — editable-mediocre (Notion / Apple Notes / Obsidian / Substack / Google Docs)
- **Camp C** — editable-beautiful (Loom's position)
- **Paper canon** — Loom's sealed v1.0 typography rules (vellum + page-on-deck + 60-72ch + zero texture, etc.)
- **3-layer architecture** — terminal AI (thinking) + Loom (rendering) + user (orchestrating)
- **AI co-edit** — selection-based AI affordances that suggest/apply edits while maintaining structural invariants
- **Structural invariant guard** — mechanism (CSS or MutationObserver) preventing user edits from breaking canon elements (drop caps, figures, ornaments)
- **Bi-directional binding** — DOM↔Markdown two-way sync; either side is single source of truth depending on direction
