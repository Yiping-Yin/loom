/**
 * Trace · the core data primitive of Loom.
 *
 * A Trace represents one unit of learning interaction. It can be:
 *   - 'reading'  — you and AI working through a source document
 *   - 'problem'  — you and AI solving a problem (with decompose/spec/execute phases)
 *   - 'concept'  — you and AI nailing down a single concept (often a child of a problem trace)
 *   - 'free'     — open-ended thinking with no source attached (the Scratchpad mode)
 *
 * Traces form a tree (parent/children). Their internal state is an append-only
 * event log — every highlight, note, message, visit, etc. is an event. The
 * "current state" of a trace is the fold of its events.
 *
 * The persistence layer (lib/trace/store) is IndexedDB.

/**
 * Epistemic type of a thought-anchor.
 *
 * Every anchor in Loom has an identity — not just content, but what KIND
 * of thought it is. This determines how it renders in the thought map,
 * how it should be challenged, and whether it can serve as evidence.
 *
 *   citation    — direct quote or close paraphrase of source
 *   explanation — unpacking what the source means
 *   inference   — a conclusion drawn from the source
 *   hypothesis  — speculative, not yet supported
 *   objection   — disagreement with or challenge to the source
 *   question    — an open question, not yet resolved
 *   conclusion  — a settled judgment (may still be revised)
